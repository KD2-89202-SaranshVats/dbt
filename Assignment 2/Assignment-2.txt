4) Why isn't it possible to see the first five rows of the table?
Answer-4) Inside a table, the rows are not stored sequentially. The rows of a table are scattered (fragmented) all over the DB server HD. The reason why MySQL does this is to speed up the INSERT statement. In a multiuser environment , if multiple users are inserting rows inside the same table simultaneously , if MySQL were to store the rows sequentially , it would be very slow. When you insert into the table, wherever MySQL finds the free space in the Db server HD , it will store the row there. When you SELECT from a table, the order of the rows in the output depends on the row address ; it will always be in Ascending order of row Address. Therefore it's not possible to see the first 5 rows of a table or the last 5 rows of a table.
